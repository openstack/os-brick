    iSCSI and FCP: Support for different SCSI addressing modes: SAM, SAM-2, and
    SAM-3 flat addressing.  Defaults to SAM/transparent, but cinder drivers can
    set key ``addressing_mode`` in the connection properties to indicate other
    addressing modes using one of the constants from
    ``os_brick.constants.SCSI_ADDRESSING_*`` as the value.

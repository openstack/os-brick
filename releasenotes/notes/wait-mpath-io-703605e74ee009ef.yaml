    `Bug #2067949 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2067949>`_:
    Fixed issue where we try to write into a multipath device and fail
    since it is not ready for I/O. Now we wait until the I/O is likely
    to succeed.
    We introduced 2 new config options to make the wait time
    configurable:

    * ``wait_mpath_device_attempts``
    * ``wait_mpath_device_interval``

    These options defaults to 4 attempts and 1 second interval
    respectively. See help text of the config options for more
    information.

    Dell PowerFlex driver `Bug #2046810
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/os-brick/+bug/2046810>`_: Added
    new error code for PowerFlex 4.x which was causing this error.
    Added handling for the new error code returned from PowerFlex
    v4.x and allow the driver to ignore and skip a disconnect
    operation when the volume is not mapped.

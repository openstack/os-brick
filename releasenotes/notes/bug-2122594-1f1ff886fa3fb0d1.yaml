    NFS driver `Bug #2122594 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2122594>`_:
    Previously we mounted NFS shares always with version 4.1 if supported
    by the client/server. Now we attempt to mount with NFSv4.2 first.
    If that fails due server/client incompatibility we will fall back
    to older versions(4.1, 4.0, 3.x).

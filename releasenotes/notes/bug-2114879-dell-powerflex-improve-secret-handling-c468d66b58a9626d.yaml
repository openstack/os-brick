    With the fix for `Bug #2114879
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2114879>`_, users do not
    need to create the `/opt/emc/scaleio/openstack/connector.conf` file
    on the hosts using ``os-brick``. Meanwhile, this version of ``os-brick``
    is compatible with Dell PowerFlex cinder driver using the legacy
    password-in-host-file strategy.

    Dell PowerFlex driver `Bug #2114879
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2114879>`_:
    This release contains an updated connector for use with
    Dell PowerFlex backend. ``os-brick`` no longer requires
    access to PowerFlex backend secrets, and all that is handled
    by the cinder driver now.

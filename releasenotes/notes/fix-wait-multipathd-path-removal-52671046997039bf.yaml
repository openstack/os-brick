    `Bug #2136842 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/os-brick/+bug/2136842>`_: Fixed
    issue with server hard reboot instance due to delayed uevent processing.
    When performing server hard reboot, the uevents for removing multipathd
    paths could be delayed and cause device removal at a later stage causing
    the device to be inaccessible. Now we wait for multipathd to remove the
    paths before marking the disconnect_volume operation complete.

fixes:
  - |
    NVMe-oF connector `bug #1964379
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/os-brick/+bug/1964379>`_: Fixed using non LUKS
    v1 encrypted volumes, as once one of such volumes is disconnected from a
    host all successive NVMe-oF attachments would fail.
  - |
    `Bug #1967790
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/os-brick/+bug/1967790>`_: Fixed encryptor's
    connect_volume returns and the symlink is pointing to the raw block device
    instead of to the decrypted device mapper device.

"""Just in case it wasn't clear, this is a massive security back-door.

`execute_root()` (or the same via `execute(run_as_root=True)`) allows
any command to be run as the privileged user (default "root").  This
is intended only as an expedient transition and should be removed
ASAP.

This is not completely unreasonable because:

1. We have no tool/workflow for merging changes to rootwrap filter
   configs from os-brick into nova/cinder, which makes it difficult
   to evolve these loosely coupled projects.

2. Let's not pretend the earlier situation was any better.  The
   rootwrap filters config contained several entries like "allow cp as
   root with any arguments", etc, and would have posed only a mild
   inconvenience to an attacker.  At least with privsep we can (in
   principle) run the "root" commands as a non-root uid, with
   restricted Linux capabilities.

The plan is to switch os-brick to privsep using this module (removing
the urgency of (1)), then work on the larger refactor that addresses
(2) in followup changes.

    Additional features are timeouts and exponential backoff retries.

    The exponential backoff retries replaces standard Oslo random sleep times
    that range from 200ms to 2seconds when attempts is greater than 1, but it
    is disabled if delay_on_retry is passed as a parameter.

    Exponential backoff is controlled via interval and backoff_rate parameters,
    just like the os_brick.utils.retry decorator.

    To use the timeout mechanism to stop the subprocess with a specific signal
    after a number of seconds we must pass a non-zero timeout value in the
    call.

    When using multiple attempts and timeout at the same time the method will
    only raise the timeout exception to the caller if the last try timeouts.

    Timeout mechanism is controlled with timeout, signal, and raise_timeout
    parameters.

    :param backoff_rate: Base used for the exponential backoff

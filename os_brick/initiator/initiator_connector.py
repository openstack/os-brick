        The connection_properties describes the information needed by
        the specific protocol to use to make the connection.

        The connection_properties is a dictionary that describes the target
        volume.  It varies slightly by protocol type (iscsi, fibre_channel),
        but the structure is usually the same.


        An example for iSCSI:

        {'driver_volume_type': 'iscsi',
         'data': {
             'target_luns': [0, 2],
             'target_iqns': ['iqn.2000-05.com.3pardata:20810002ac00383d',
                             'iqn.2000-05.com.3pardata:21810002ac00383d'],
             'target_discovered': True,
             'encrypted': False,
             'qos_specs': None,
             'target_portals': ['10.52.1.11:3260', '10.52.2.11:3260'],
             'access_mode': 'rw',
        }}

        An example for fibre_channel with single lun:

        {'driver_volume_type': 'fibre_channel',
         'data': {
            'initiator_target_map': {'100010604b010459': ['20210002AC00383D'],
                                     '100010604b01045d': ['20220002AC00383D']},
            'target_discovered': True,
            'encrypted': False,
            'qos_specs': None,
            'target_lun': 1,
            'access_mode': 'rw',
            'target_wwn': [
                '20210002AC00383D',
                '20220002AC00383D',
                ],
         }}

        An example for fibre_channel target_wwns and with different LUNs and
        all host ports mapped to target ports:

        {'driver_volume_type': 'fibre_channel',
         'data': {
            'initiator_target_map': {
                '100010604b010459': ['20210002AC00383D', '20220002AC00383D'],
                '100010604b01045d': ['20210002AC00383D', '20220002AC00383D']
                },
            'target_discovered': True,
            'encrypted': False,
            'qos_specs': None,
            'target_luns': [1, 2],
            'access_mode': 'rw',
            'target_wwns': ['20210002AC00383D', '20220002AC00383D'],
         }}

         For FC the dictionary could also present the enable_wildcard_scan key
         with a boolean value (defaults to True) in case a driver doesn't want
         OS-Brick to use a SCSI scan with wildcards when the FC initiator on
         the host doesn't find any target port.

         This is useful for drivers that know that sysfs gets populated
         whenever there's a connection between the host's HBA and the storage
         array's target ports.

        Encrypted volumes have some peculiar requirements on the path that must
        be returned, so it is recommended to decorate the method with the
        os_brick.utils.connect_volume_prepare_result to ensure that the right
        device path is returned to the caller.

        :param connection_properties: The dictionary that describes all
                                      of the target volume attributes.
